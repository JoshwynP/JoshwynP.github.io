        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>UW Computer Engineering Student | Seeking Innovative Opportunities</p>
        <p>I'm Joshwyn Parekh, a dedicated Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in automation, C++ programming, and game development. Eager to expand my skills and tackle new challenges, I thrive on continuous learning and innovation. My journey in technology began with a passion for coding, leading me to explore the realms of game development using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. Along side my studies, I've honed my abilities as a professional tennis coach and website designer, fostering adaptability and effective communication skills. Driven by a desire for continuous improvement, I approach every project with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. With a blend of technical expertise and creativity, I'm poised to make meaningful contributions to the dynamic world of technology.</p>
        <p>During my first co-op term, I had the privilege of working as a Certification Intern at Dematic. In this role, I honed my skills in C programming by developing Matflo certifications, and delved into the world of autonomous workflows to efficiently manage strenuous daily tasks. This innovative approach not only saved valuable time but also reduced the margin for error, ultimately enhancing productivity and ensuring the smooth execution of essential functions. I was thrilled to be part of a team that ensured our work met the highest quality standards.</p>
        <p>During my second co-op at Dematic as a Front-End Instructional Designer, I demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, creating visually appealing interfaces using HTML and CSS. Collaborating closely with controls engineers, I not only integrated technical content seamlessly into our learning management system but also led initiatives to automate certain processes, streamlining workflow efficiency. Leveraging 3D and 2D modeling techniques, I played a pivotal role in crafting engaging visuals and multimedia content, enhancing the effectiveness of educational materials and presentations. Additionally, I maintained internal documentation platforms for organizational knowledge and provided prompt assistance to users and instructors, contributing to the completion of over 100 Jira tickets. Grateful for the mentorship, I'm eager to apply these skills in future endeavors.</p>

            <h3>Sw1ft Shot</h3>
            <p>"Sw1ft Shot" is an exhilarating speed-run focused target shooting game developed by me from its inception to its current stage. The game features multiple levels with varying difficulty, themes, and obstacles to overcome. Leveraging the power of Unreal Engine 5, I utilized its Blueprint Visual Scripting system alongside custom C++ code to design and implement intricate gameplay mechanics, including dynamic target and obstacle movement algorithms, scoring systems, and engaging character interactions. Additionally, I meticulously crafted captivating levels and environments within "Sw1ft Shot," employing industry-standard tools and techniques to create diverse landscapes and challenging obstacles. To ensure an immersive gaming experience, I implemented intuitive user interfaces and visually striking HUD elements, applying principles of UI/UX design for seamless navigation and enhanced player immersion.</p>

            <h3>Ice Cube Splash</h3>
            <p>Skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3D modeling</li>
                <li>Animation</li>
                <li>Liquid simulation</li>
                <li>Lighting & shading</li>
                <li>Rendering within Blender</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this Blender project I crafted four realistic ice cubes falling into red water. Throughout the project, I delved into various aspects of 3D modeling, refining my skills in creating detailed and lifelike objects. From shaping the ice cubes to designing the glass cup, I honed my ability to capture realistic textures and proportions. Moreover, I explored animation techniques to bring the ice cubes to life as they descended into the liquid. This involved working with keyframe animations and timing to achieve natural and fluid motion. Additionally, I utilized blender's own liquid simulation, experimenting with parameters to accurately depict the behavior of the liquid as the ice cubes interacted with it. Furthermore, I gained experience in lighting, shading, and rendering to enhance the visual quality of the scene. Adjusting lighting setups and applying appropriate materials to the objects allowed me to achieve a more realistic and visually appealing result.</p>
