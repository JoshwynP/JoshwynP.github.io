        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>UW Computer Engineering Student | Seeking Innovative Opportunities</p>
        <p>I'm Joshwyn Parekh, a dedicated Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in automation, C++ programming, and game development. Eager to expand my skills and tackle new challenges, I thrive on continuous learning and innovation. My journey in technology began with a passion for coding, leading me to explore the realms of game development using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. Along side my studies, I've honed my abilities as a professional tennis coach and website designer, fostering adaptability and effective communication skills. Driven by a desire for continuous improvement, I approach every project with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. With a blend of technical expertise and creativity, I'm poised to make meaningful contributions to the dynamic world of technology.</p>
        <p>During my first co-op term, I had the privilege of working as a Certification Intern at Dematic. In this role, I honed my skills in C programming by developing Matflo certifications, and delved into the world of autonomous workflows to efficiently manage strenuous daily tasks. This innovative approach not only saved valuable time but also reduced the margin for error, ultimately enhancing productivity and ensuring the smooth execution of essential functions. I was thrilled to be part of a team that ensured our work met the highest quality standards.</p>
        <p>During my second co-op at Dematic as a Front-End Instructional Designer, I demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, creating visually appealing interfaces using HTML and CSS. Collaborating closely with controls engineers, I not only integrated technical content seamlessly into our learning management system but also led initiatives to automate certain processes, streamlining workflow efficiency. Leveraging 3D and 2D modeling techniques, I played a pivotal role in crafting engaging visuals and multimedia content, enhancing the effectiveness of educational materials and presentations. Additionally, I maintained internal documentation platforms for organizational knowledge and provided prompt assistance to users and instructors, contributing to the completion of over 100 Jira tickets. Grateful for the mentorship, I'm eager to apply these skills in future endeavors.</p>
        <p>Let's connect and share our passion for technology, engineering, and innovation!</p>
